primitive.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save shallow-clone\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar clone = require('shallow-clone');\n```\n\n## shallow clones arrays\n\nThe array itself is cloned, but not the elements of the array. So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).\n\n```js\nvar arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\nvar foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert.equal(actual === expected, false);\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## returns primitives as-is\n\n```js\nclone(0)\n//=> 0\n\nclone('foo')\n//=> 'foo'\n```\n\n## shallow clone a regex\n\n```js\nclone(/foo/g)\n//=> /foo/g\n```\n\n## shallow clone an object\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## About\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Contributing</strong></summary>\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
